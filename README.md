everyauth-example-password
==========================

This is just a modified version of the everyauth example from:

  https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth

I stripped out the non-password parts of the example, and switched
it to use 'login' as the key, instead of 'email'.

I'm just evaluating different options for doing auth for express
applications, so I'd figure I'd share my experiments on GitHub.

## Running it
    $ npm install
    $ node server.js

Go to http://localhost:3001
